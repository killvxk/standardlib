<h2>Features:</h2>
<ul class="features-list">
<li>→Zero Overhead</li>
<li>→Static Inline Functions</li>
<li>→No macros or <span style=font-style:normal;><code>#defines</code></span></li>
<li>→No namespace pollution - you can generate your <span style=font-style:normal;><b>own version</b></span> with any prefix you like! (<span style=font-style:normal;>and you will own the copyrights for this version</span>)</li>
<li>→Relies <span style=font-style:normal;>minimally</span> on C libraries<li>→<span style=font-style:normal;><b>Very
small</b></span> - 5K Lines of Code</li><li>→No <span style='color:rgb(240, 0, 0);'>Linkage Issues</span> or <span style='color:rgb(240, 0, 0);'>dependency hell</span></li><li>→Thoroughly
Tested - 0 warnings or errors or memory leaks in Valgrind</li><li>→Good documentation</li><li>→
Free and open source - no licensing restrictions whatsoever</li><li>→Makes C like
Python or Perl or Ruby - or more easy</li>

<div class="library-details"><h2 style=color:green;><i>What is this? Let me elaborate:</i></h2>
<p class=feature>
<strong>Functional Programming Features</strong> - <code>map, reduce, filter,</code> List Comprehensions in C and much more!</p>
<p class=feature><strong>Expands C's Primitives</strong> for easy
manipulation of types such as <code>FrozenDict, Set, FrozenSet, FrozenDict,
Arrays, and Strings,</code> and provides easy manipulation, modification,
alteration and duplication of these at a very comfortable level -
something very, very rare in C or C++, <i>all without any overhead.</i></p>

<p class=feature><strong>More comfortable IO</strong> - read and write entire files with ease, and convert
complex types into strings or print them on the screen with ease. </p>

<p class=feature><strong>Powerful array operations</strong> like <code>transform()</code> help to deal with complex
problems and programming challenges like dealing with matrices.</p>
<p class=feature><strong>A powerful general purpose standard library</strong> has anything and
everything you need - from <code>find_last_of()</code> to <code>count_vowels()</code>
to <code>list_comprehension()</code> to <code>shellescape()</code> to <code>read_file()</code> to
<code>string_to_json()</code> to <code>string_to_uppercase()</code> to <code>to_title_case()</code> to <code>map()</code>
to <code>reduce()</code> to <code>filter()</code> to <code>list_comprehension()</code> to <code>frozen_dict_new_instance()</code> - everything you would want to make quick
and optimally efficient C programs, this has it. And all without the overhead of external linkage - the code will be inlined and will be quicker than anything else.</p>
<div style='height: 1px; border: 0;border-bottom: 1px dashed rgb(200, 200, 200);'></div>

<p class=performance><span>Helps to make programs hundreds of times faster than other languages with similar ease of creation</span>

<h3>You don't want to be waiting <span style='color:rgb(240, 0, 0);'>a day</span> for an operation to complete when it could take <span style='color:rgb(30, 30, 255);'>less than an hour</span>.</h3>
